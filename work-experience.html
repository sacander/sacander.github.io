									<h3>Academic Tutor</h3>
									<h4 class="major">Sole trader &emsp; (January 2023 - Present)</h4>
									<p>
										I provide private tutoring to students primarily for SACE Stage 2 Specialist Mathematics, Mathematical Methods, Chemistry and Physics, 
										however also offer tutoring for computer science and other levels of science and mathematics. This also involves other business activities such 
										as finding customers, managing paperwork, and planning schedules which requires a high level of organisation. Additionally, communication is 
										extremely important, and it is neccessary to adapt to individual students to find the best way to support them.
									<p>
									<p>
										I have received extremely positive feedback from my first year of tutoring after officially registering a business, with a few of the comments 
										displayed here:
										<blockquote>
											Overall I improved by an enormous step in comparison to when I didn't go to homework club at all. I am very grateful for this year's tutoring and the 
											additional resources were very useful for end of year exams as well as class summative tests.
										</blockquote>
										<blockquote>
											Zachary is super helpful in helping you understand difficult topics as he explains it thoroughly inside out. His technique of explaining 
											things and running his sessions make it suitable for him to tutor anyone. He helped me throughout the year in grasping concepts which 
											allowed me to be successful in my chosen subjects. Couldn't recommend him enough!
										</blockquote>
										<blockquote>
											You always have a positive attitude that supports us throughout Year 12. You are always happy to answer any concerns and questions for 
											confirmation. You communicate well with every student to engage and assist with their own enquiries about subject matters. Throughout 
											year 12, I gained additional knowledge from your analytical and comprehensive breakdown of each topic, which comprises detailed 
											explanations and clear layouts of each step in solving difficult questions.
										</blockquote>
										I also asked my students for a rating out of 10 on six criteria, with my average scores shown below: <br><br>
										Reliability: 9.9 <br>
										Friendliness: 9.9 <br>
										Helpfulness: 9.4 <br>
										On Demand Support (Outside of Sessions): 9.3 <br>
										Extra/Supporting Matierals: 9.6 <br>
										Overall: 9.6
									<p>

									<h3>Academic Content Creator</h3>
									<h4 class="major">TutorsSA &emsp; (January 2023 - Present)</h4>
									<p>
										As a contract content developer, I have produced worked solutions for various Year 5 - Year 10 mathematics worksheets and developed the full 
										range of Stage 1 Chemistry resources. I am currently leading the expansion of the Stage 1 Specialist Mathematics resources to include full 
										worksheets and practice tests for each topic, in addition to mini-exams covering a range of topics. Clear communication is particularly 
										important to this work, as it is neccessary to clearly and concisely convey all the information needed for a question without giving too much 
										away.
									<p>
									
									<br>

									<h3>Academic Tutor and Tennis Coach</h3>
									<h4 class="major">Saint Ignatius' College, Adelaide &emsp; (February 2023 - Present)</h4>
									<p>
										I am fortunate enough to be able to return to my old high school to perform some casual work, particularly aiding students after school at 
										Homework Club once a week. I also coached a year 7 tennis team which I unfortunately am not continuing with due to university commitments.
